Air Mozilla
=======

Air Mozilla is the Internet multimedia presence of Mozilla, with live and
pre-recorded shows, interviews, news snippets, tutorial videos, and
features about the Mozilla community.

We are rebuilding Air Mozilla to use [Mozilla's Playdoh][gh-playdoh],
a web application template based on [Django][django],
and adding some neat features along the way.
